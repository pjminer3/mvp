- Webpack, packages.json, babel-cli, react-dev, dependencies & dev-dependencies (what is the difference?)...
  How do we know what to download/use? When to use it? How to use it? When did we learn this stuff?
  What is babel? Webpack? What do they do? Nodemon, deamons, what do all these things mean and how do we know when to use each?
  "babel-core": "^6.23.1",
    "babel-loader": "^6.3.2",
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.22.0",
    "babel-preset-react": "^6.23.0",  <-- without looking at the documentation how would we be expected to know to download them?
    AND LIKE THIS: npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-cli babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react webpack html-webpack-plugin
    AND LIKE THIS: touch .babelrc webpack-server

- What exactly get's exported when exporting a React component?  Where does it go and how does it go to wait to be used?
- app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/../client/dist')); <== Why does this fail when you add the file name? What if there was more than 1 html file in this directory?
- How do I get data back from the server to the client without accessing the database?
