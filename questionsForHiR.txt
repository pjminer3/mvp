- Webpack, packages.json, babel-cli, react-dev, dependencies & dev-dependencies (what is the difference?)...
  How do we know what to download/use? When to use it? How to use it? When did we learn this stuff?
  What is babel? Webpack? What do they do? Nodemon, deamons, what do all these things mean and how do we know when to use each?
  "babel-core": "^6.23.1",
    "babel-loader": "^6.3.2",
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.22.0",
    "babel-preset-react": "^6.23.0",  <-- without looking at the documentation how would we be expected to know to download them?
